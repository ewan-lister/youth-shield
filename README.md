# Youth-Shield
A repository for the project and future device developed Spring 2024 at UW ECE.

We wrote this code to be integratable with the Arduino Libraries used during the EE400 class as many of them are standard for class based TinyML learning.

They are listed below:

TensorFlow Lite Micro Library for Arduino

Harvard_TinyMLx

Arduino_LSM9DS1

ArduinoBLE

After installing these libraries and downloading our provided code, you should be able to run our model.
